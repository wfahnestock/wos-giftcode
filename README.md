Century Game has changed their website in a way that redeeming gift codes automatically is not possible anymore, so this repository has been archived. 

# Whiteout Survival Giftcode Redeemer
### NOTE: THIS <u>DOES NOT</u> "GENERATE" GIFT CODES. THIS SIMPLY AUTOMATICALLY REDEEMS <u>VALID</u> GIFT CODES THROUGH THEIR WEBSITE.

## Usage
Build & Run "wos-giftcode.exe". Enter your player ID(s) in players.txt and the gift codes in codes.txt and run the program in batch mode (option 2) to go through both lists automatically. Alternatively, you can use single mode (option 1) to enter <u>ONE</u> player and gift code.
